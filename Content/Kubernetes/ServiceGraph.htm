        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="local.ServiceGraph" /> graphically displays all the connections made between services within and outside the cluster, in a specific time frame. If no connections are made to a service during the time frame selected, it will not appear in the <MadCap:variable name="local.ServiceGraph" />. Every service displayed has an associated <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.TufinScore" />.</p>
        <p>Services that are outside the currently selected <a href="../SecureCloud/Navigation.htm#k8sfilterning">namespace filter</a> are marked with 'Ext' (external).</p>

        <h3>View Reputation Information </h3>
        <p>Clicking on an external end-point will display an analysis of the site's reputation including information about the domain and a high-level vulnerability summary.</p>
        <p>The analysis information is provided through a 3rd party called Reposify. If Reposify doesn't have data for the site, you will be automatically redirected to the appropriate page on the Talos reputation website (<a href="http://www.talosintelligence.com/">www.talosintelligence.com</a>).</p>
        <h3><a name="ConnectionHistory"></a>Traffic Time Frame</h3>
        <p>The Traffic Time Frame is the length of time that <MadCap:variable name="local-orca.Product_L" /> considers a connection as active. Connections are displayed in the Service Graph for services that have had active traffic during the time frame selected. If no traffic has originated from or into a service during the time frame selected, that service will not appear in the Service Graph.</p>
