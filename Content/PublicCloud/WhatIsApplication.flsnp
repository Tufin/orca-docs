        <p>An application in <MadCap:variable name="local.ProductName" /> is a logical entity defined by its assets. <MadCap:variable name="local.ProductName" /> identifies your applications through the tags you have assigned to your assets.  These may be native asset  tags defined in your cloud environment or custom tags created  in  the <MadCap:variable name="local.ProductName" /> <a href="WorkingWithTagManager.htm">Tag Manager</a>. </p>
        <p>For <MadCap:variable name="local.ProductName" /> to identify your applications, you need to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Define tags directly on your assets and / or define custom tags, which are identifiers based on asset properties.</li>
            <li>Specify how you want to use tags  to identify applications. This is done in the <a href="WorkingWithAppManager.htm">App Manager</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition to the applications defined in this way by the asset tags, an additional application named Default will contain all the assets that have not been aligned with a specific application. </p>
